###The project consists of a single page.

1. In the center of the screen there is an 500px x 500px bordered box. The border is dashed and the box has a shadow.

2. The box contains two inputs and a button. All three elements are in the center of the screen.

3. The button is green and it's color changes to blue when it's first pressed.

4. The text in the inputs will be saved in a reducer which have the following initial state: { input1: '', input2: '' }

5. In the top-left corner (you can position it with 'relative') there is a text which represents the text in the first input box. (you must take the state from the redux store)
